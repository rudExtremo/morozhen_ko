## Hi 👋

I’m a full-stack indie developer with a strong QA background.

I build and ship real products end-to-end: web and mobile apps, APIs, integrations, payments, and deployment.

Most of my projects are private or commercial, so the source code is not publicly available.
I use AI tools to speed up development, but I fully understand the architecture, logic, and trade-offs behind the code.

If you’re interested in specific projects or technical details, feel free to ask.
